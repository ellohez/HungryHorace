### Project Brief - Search
In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The standard
project uses the Edamam Recipe API, but can be changed to use a different API after completing
the required tasks.
You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete this
project.

**Required Tasks** 
To use the Edamam API you will need to register for an account. In your Edamam account
dashboard you can find an Application ID and Application Key, which you will need to make
requests to the API.
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.
Required Tasks
1. Read the Edamam API documentation ★
https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
2. Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for
3. Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required ingredient as
part of the search query (also included your Application ID and Application Key
4. Get the returned recipes from the API response
5. Display the recipes for each search result

**Ideas for Extending the Project**
Here are a few ideas for extending the project beyond the required tasks. These ideas are just
suggestions, feel free to come up with your own ideas and extend the program however you want.
● Save the results to a file
● Order the results by weight or another piece of data
● Ask the user additional questions to decide which recipe they should choose
● Cross-reference the ingredient against the Edamam nutrition analysis API
● Use a different searchable API (suggestions in useful resources)

**Useful Resources**
API for Anime and Manga

● Official Documentation ★ https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
● Python library for Spotify API ★ https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Twitter API (can be very difficult to use as it requires a more complicated setup process)
